## Completed Items ‚úÖ
- [x] Basic Streamlit UI structure
- [x] Agent management UI with table view
- [x] Tool management UI with table view
- [x] Agent creation modal with tool selection
- [x] Agent editing functionality

## Notes
- Consider using MongoDB Atlas free tier for initial development
- PostgreSQL might be better for production due to ACID compliance
- Streamlit Cloud can be used for free hosting of the UI
- FastAPI can be deployed on Railway, Render, or Heroku for free tiers
- Consider using GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline

## Next Sprint Focus
1. Set up database connection (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
2. Create API endpoints for agent/tool CRUD operations
3. Connect Streamlit UI to FastAPI backend
4. Implement basic prompt generator functionality
