# TODO - AI Agent Management Platform

## ‚úÖ Completed (Recent Cleanup & Refactoring)

### Project Structure & Organization
- [x] **Modularized Streamlit App**: Broke down 500+ line monolithic app into focused components
- [x] **Created Component Architecture**: 
  - `app/components/agent_management.py` - Agent CRUD operations
  - `app/components/tool_management.py` - Tool management functionality
  - `app/components/chat_interface.py` - Chat interface implementation
  - `app/components/system_monitoring.py` - System health monitoring
- [x] **Simplified Main App**: Reduced `streamlit_app.py` to ~100 lines with clean routing
- [x] **Single Command Launch**: Created `launch.py` for one-command startup
- [x] **Developer Tools**: Added Makefile with common commands
- [x] **Project Cleanup**: Removed duplicate and unnecessary files
- [x] **Updated Documentation**: Refreshed README with quick start guide

### Code Quality
- [x] **Import Organization**: Moved imports to top level in streamlit_app.py
- [x] **Error Handling**: Improved import error handling with user-friendly messages
- [x] **Path Management**: Fixed Python path issues for proper module imports
- [x] **Session State**: Proper initialization of Streamlit session state

## üìã Notes

### Recent Changes Impact
- The modular component architecture makes it much easier to:
  - Add new features to specific sections
  - Test individual components
  - Maintain and debug the codebase
  - Onboard new developers

### Development Workflow
1. Use `python launch.py` for development
2. Use `make setup-test` to verify setup
3. Use `make clean` to clean up cache files
4. Individual components can be developed and tested in isolation

### Priority Guidelines
- **High Priority**: Core functionality needed for MVP
- **Medium Priority**: Features that enhance user experience
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have features and optimizations
